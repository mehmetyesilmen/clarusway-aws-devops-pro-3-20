Calling python program:
1. python file.py

2. python -c "print('Hello')""

3. Create here document and call it

code=$(cat <<ANY
name=input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello', name)
ANY
)
python3 -c "$code"


Functions:

message="Hello"
name="Ahmet"

function say_hello() {
        local name="Ajay"
        echo "$message $name"
}

echo "$message $name"

say_hello

echo "$message $name"


Excercise:
Create a function named print_age that accepts one argument
Ask user to input his/her year of birth and store it to local birth_year variable
Calculate age using current year value from the first argument
Print age with a message

Call print_age function with 2020

print_age() {
        read -p "Enter your birth year: " birth_year
        let age=$1-birth_year
        echo "Your age must be $age"
}

print_age 2020

File watcher excercise:

Write a script that checks periodically whether clarusway.txt exists in the current directory. Control period will be provided as argument.
If the file is found the script will move the file to the archive directory. File name will be replaced with clarusway_[datetime].txt to keep all the files. “archive” directory needs to be created if not exist.
Run the script on the background.
Test the script
Terminate the script


while :
do

        count=$(find . -name "clarusway.txt" | wc -l)
        if [ $count -gt 0 ]
        then
                ls archive || mkdir archive
                now=$(date +"%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M_%S")
                mv clarusway.txt archive/clarusway_$now.txt
        fi
        sleep $1
done
